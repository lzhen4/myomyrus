Here are tools that I put together to facilitate data analysis and visualization. These tools are free to use and adapt.

# CensusGIS
CensusGIS is a Windows app for exploring demographic data on an interactive map. This release uses data from the 2023 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates via the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP5Y2023.DP05?q=DP05). Just enter an address, and the app will show census tract details, including Asian and Chinese population percentages, on a map. Right now, it covers New Jersey and New York. 

This version focuses on the specific data I needed for a project, but the source code is available in the resources folder and can be easily customized for your work.
