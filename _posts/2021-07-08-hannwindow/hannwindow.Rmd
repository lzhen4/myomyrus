Soundcards and transducers can at times produce an audible pop at the onset or offset of a signal. The **Hann window**, AKA hanning or raised cosine filter, is one of many windowing functions that can be applied to account for these distortions. The filter gradually ramps up from 0 amplitude and back down. Applying the window to the onset (on ramp) and offset (off ramp) of a signal gives the transducer some "transition" time to reach full signal amplitude.

The wav_maker function generates a range of pure tones from *f0* to *f1*, applies the Hann window to each signal, and saves each signal to a separate .wav file.

    starting frequncy (f0) in Hz

    signal plus ramp total duration (d) in ms
    phase offset (p) in radians
    ramp duration (ramp_d) in ms

        freq_list.append(f)
        
        if freq_list[0+index] < f1+1:
            sin_sig = thinkdsp.SinSignal(freq = freq_list[0+index], amp = A, offset = p) # generate sine wave
