My research journey started with studying how these creatures learned spatial information.\r\nI have been electrocuted by lively specimens of Malapterurus electricus, African electric catfish, on multiple occasions. It was electrifying.\r\ncontact\r\nlez35@pitt.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Iâ€™m interested in how we learn and process the sounds that we hear.\r\nHere is some of my recent work.\r\nmemory & central auditory processing\r\npresented at JDVAC 2021\r\nCentral auditory processing describes how the brain processes sound beyond the cochlea. Some assessment tools for central auditory processing can be especially challenging for veterans at elevated risk for memory deficits related to traumatic brain injuries and/or post-traumatic stress disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\ncomorbidities & hearing loss in veterans\r\npresented at JDVAC 2021\r\nMore and more veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are complaining of having hearing problems, but their hearing tests are typically normal. Might their comorbidities explain their hearing problems?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
