## bio
I'm a researcher in-training at the University of Pittsburgh.

My research centers on how we learn and process the sounds that we hear. I use advanced regression and predictive modelling techniques in R and Python to support this work.


## trivia
- Despite what this homepage might suggest, I am not a KEMAR.
- The github repository for this website, myomyrus, is named after [*Myomyrus rume*](https://www.google.com/search?q=mormyrus+rume&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi1z76A_sP9AhW3F1kFHd71BdQQ0pQJegQIBhAC&biw=1920&bih=937), weakly electric elephant-nose fish hailing from South Africa. My research journey started with studying how these creatures learn spatial information.
